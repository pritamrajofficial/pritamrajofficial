# 👋🏻 Hey there, I'm Pritam Raj!

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate **Data Scientist** with over 3 years of experience transforming messy data into meaningful insights. My journey in data science has been a blend of curiosity, creativity, and code — driven by a mission to build intelligent systems that actually matter.

Currently, I’m working at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Generative AI**, and **MLOps**, solving real-world problems with clean models, scalable workflows, and a bit of data-driven magic. Whether it’s crunching numbers, visualizing patterns, or deploying models, I love crafting solutions that are as elegant as they are effective.

When I’m not deep in a Jupyter notebook or building pipelines, I’m geeking out over tech innovations, space science, and futuristic AI ideas.
